- 0. This Library don't compile.
	 Because you need solved all puzzles in following.

- 1, Preprocessing directive
	 (1)#import
		#import in the mt4editer is a predefine word. And it is worked in VS.
     Because have some unidentify file type in VS and it is defference means of
	 the word. So it didn't well worked in VS to mt4Editer files.  
	 so is problem.

		See the problem of first show in WinUser32.h -> #import "user32.dll"

	 (2)#property 
		#property perdefine word  of unquite in Mql language. SO you need annotate it
	 in VS Platform.

	 (3)Each other preprocessing directive (#if #ifndef #ifdef #else #endif #undef in C language)
		They are don't unidentify in Mql language. So if you writed mql file with used the
     MT4Library  library in VS that you need annotate them when open mql file in mt4editer.exe 

- 2, (已解决 template<>) parameter "..." 
		Unsure parameters of functions    
		
		See the problem of first show: 
		indicators.h -> iCustom()
		CommonFun.h  -> Alert()/Print()/Comment()

- 3, predefine variables
		Ask/Bid/Digits etc. This puzzle is sovled use #define.
        so you need additinoal 'PreVariable' marco of head part of mq4 files. Please detail in 
	 readme.txt

- 4, (已解决）string type
		In VS and MT4Editer, use same word indicate to character stream(constant of variable). 
	 But they have a difference part of in using. In the VS, you can just assign  one constant
	 character stream use overload operator '+' in string on single line. But in MT4 platform,
	 you can assign amount of unsure of constant character stream to string type. 
	 
		See the problem of first show in CommonFun.h -> Alert()/Print()/comment().
		But there an another way to solved this problem.For example:
		
		string var;
			var += ...;
			var += ...;

- 5, color type and datetime type
		No support assigment use '' operator. For exmpale:
		color c = C'012,012,120';
		datetime d = D'2013 10 10 12:12';

- 6, （已解决 现版本已和VS模式相同，不存在这种问题了。）variable of control block
		In the VS platform, the exist period of variable just in sign "{}". So, you can use same
	 name of variable in derfference control block. But in the MT4Editer the variable's exist 
	 period is whole of start() function. For example, if you use 'for' operator as 
							for( int i = 0; i<limit; i++) {
							}
							for( int i = 0; i<limit; i++) {
							}
		It is normally in VS. But if you use 'for'  operator as it in MT4Editer. There an error 
	 will warning to you. So, you need call defference name for every local variable. 

- 7, void &variable/ Type &arrary[]/ void arrary[];
		The he VS platform can't used '&' in void/arrary and 'void arrary[]'
		void &variable -> void variable;
		Type &arrary[] -> Type arrary[];
		void arrary[]  -> template<>

		CommonFun.h
		ArratSeries.h
		ConverType.h
		MarketInfo.h
